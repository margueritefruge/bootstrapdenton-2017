**Bootstrap Denton** is a celebration of the Denton startup / tech / creative community. We started hosting this event in 2014 as TechMill's launch event, but we wanted to showcase the diversity and breadth of the community and all the gears involved in moving it forward.

We put this event on as a free event to encourage the greater North Texas community to join us and check out how awesome the Denton community is! We're curate the community to support all varieties of backgrounds, whether they're designers, marketers, developers, bizdev, etc - technical or non-technical, every single person make the community what it is.

We're a nonprofit run by volunteers. Every dollar that goes into our organization is put directly back into the community. With your company's sponsorship, you're helping support the events like Bootstrap Denton, educational workshops, one-day conferences, and numerous other activities engaging our local entrepreneurs, freelancers, creatives, and college students.
