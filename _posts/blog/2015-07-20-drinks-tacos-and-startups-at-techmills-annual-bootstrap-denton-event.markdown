**Denton's tech scene celebrating continued growth at Harvest House next month

The city of Denton has seen a massive and energetic upshift in the last few years, and if you want to be a part of it, Bootstrap Denton is the place to be. 

"We held this event last year as a kick-off launch party for TechMill," says Kyle Taylor, "and we invited basically the whole city to join. But we also wanted to showcase other organizations in our community, so they could talk about what they're doing and how the people of Denton can get involved."

This year's event will give tech creatives, entrepreneurs, or wanna-be-startups an opportunity to learn about what's going on in everyone's favorite college town. 

Denton was named 6th on a list of top 25 U.S. counties for high-tech jobs (beating out Travis County) back in 2014. The continued support from the city of Denton for tech initiatives has made the community a stronger network for the entrepreneurs and tech creatives there. 

"We're really excited about this year's event -- with opportunities to hear from local startups, a food truck, and networking, there are so many good reasons to join us. And the first drink is on us!" says Taylor.
